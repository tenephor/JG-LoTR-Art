# JG-LoTR-Art
JG's LoTR artwork catalog

Many of us are familiar with those "stained glass" LOTR art works that occasionally get posted. Did you know that there are over 75 works of art by Jian? And he's added new ones since you last looked. When you consider all the variants the count gets well into the hundreds.  
  
Presented here is (what I think is) a complete itemisation of his artworks (only his LOTR artworks, he paints a lot of other fandoms). It's organised as a list with an artwork number JG*n* with a description, and links to online versions of each artwork. The number is meaningless outside this list, its just to reference for discussion.  
   
The two main repositories linked for the works are Deviant Art and INprnt. These hold some works in common, but each have unique variants. His works can be purchased. There will likely be work here listed that you haven't seen.  
  
On Deviant Art, a larger view of each artwork can be had by clicking on the artwork. For INprnt you have to right-click on the artwork and select "open image in new window".  

Support this amazing artist!
Enjoy!  
  
  
### JG1: A Sudden in Love
Captures the meeting between Beren and Lúthien. Beren saw Lúthien dancing under moonrise in her father's forest, and fell in love with her, captivated by her beauty.
